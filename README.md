For this project, we want to explore tools like Unreal Engine and Houdini to create a procedurally generated underwater environment. We were primarily inspired by Atlantis concept art made by various artists. 

**Specifications:**
- Different styles of procedural buildings; Greek-inspired architecture
- Big landmarks such as coliseums
- Breaking simulations on architecture
- City structure with walkways
- Niagara system fish flocks
- Different fish such as jellyfish, stingray, sharks, etc.
- Ornaments like benches, streetlights, etc.
- L system kelp & coral
- Water caustics
- Procedural materials: Mossy & damaged marble; Sand w/ starfish, barnacles, fossils etc.

## Milestone 1: Implementation part 1

### Ray's Milestone 1
For this milestone, I implemented some basic building structure to work with the map layout. 

Each building is built off a base, which is an irregular polygon with some number of vertices. Each cell generated by the voronoi structure from Neha's implementation this week is used as a base for a building. 

To start with, I calculate the area of the base, which will determine the type of building spawned by the voronoi cell. These sizes are small, medium, and large. Small "buildings" are basic park structures with plants/benches, medium buildings are normal houses, and large buildings are houses with courtyards. This week I implemented houses with courtyards because those are the most difficult, and I can build medium-sized buildings from them.

In this example, I'm hard-coding the base as a 20-sided circle, and generating a large building on top of it.

First, I do some extrusions to get the base thickness of the wall. Then I search around the input base for an appropriate area to place the entrance to the courtyard, which is pictured here.

Using more extrusions and a chain node around the perimeter of the base shape, I generate walls and windows. I made sure to add a check for the courtyard entrance so that no windows get placed there. Also, I decided to create each individual wall, since I plan on adding a destruction simulation later and want to show the structure of the house where the roof caves in.

Here's the draft for a tiled roof, along with placements for plants and such in the courtyard! I plan on polishing the building up much more in the next milestone.

## Neha's Milestone 1

For the first milestone, I followed along with this <a href="https://www.sidefx.com/tutorials/foundations-build-a-city-with-pdg/" />tutorial</a> about PDG's in Houdini. This tutorial went over how to construct a stereotypical grid-based city using Houdini PDG's. In order to follow our Atlantis theme, rather than a grid, we used two circles that were broken up by different Voronoi fractures. The bigger voronoi fracture created the overall layout of the city, while the smaller voronoi fracture further split the larger shape and created smaller streets and tiles on which to place our buildings/structures.

The process of creating buildings on the tiles was done via a topnet. Which can be seen here:

## Milestone 1: Implementation part 1 (due 11/13)
Begin implementing your engine! Don't worry too much about polish or parameter tuning -- this week is about getting together the bulk of your generator implemented. By the end of the week, even if your visuals are crude, the majority of your generator's functionality should be done.

Put all your code in your forked repository.

Submission: Add a new section to your README titled: Milestone #1, which should include
- written description of progress on your project goals. If you haven't hit all your goals, what's giving you trouble?
- Examples of your generators output so far
We'll check your repository for updates. No need to create a new pull request.
## Milestone 2: Implementation part 2 (due 11/25)
We're over halfway there! This week should be about fixing bugs and extending the core of your generator. Make sure by the end of this week _your generator works and is feature complete._ Any core engine features that don't make it in this week should be cut! Don't worry if you haven't managed to exactly hit your goals. We're more interested in seeing proof of your development effort than knowing your planned everything perfectly. 

Put all your code in your forked repository.

Submission: Add a new section to your README titled: Milestone #3, which should include
- written description of progress on your project goals. If you haven't hit all your goals, what did you have to cut and why? 
- Detailed output from your generator, images, video, etc.
We'll check your repository for updates. No need to create a new pull request.

Come to class on the due date with a WORKING COPY of your project. We'll be spending time in class critiquing and reviewing your work so far.

## Final submission (due 12/2)
Time to polish! Spen this last week of your project using your generator to produce beautiful output. Add textures, tune parameters, play with colors, play with camera animation. Take the feedback from class critques and use it to take your project to the next level.

Submission:
- Push all your code / files to your repository
- Come to class ready to present your finished project
- Update your README with two sections 
  - final results with images and a live demo if possible
  - post mortem: how did your project go overall? Did you accomplish your goals? Did you have to pivot?

## Topic Suggestions

### Create a generator in Houdini

### A CLASSIC 4K DEMO
- In the spirit of the demo scene, create an animation that fits into a 4k executable that runs in real-time. Feel free to take inspiration from the many existing demos. Focus on efficiency and elegance in your implementation.
- Example: 
  - [cdak by Quite & orange](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCh3Q08HMfs&list=PLA5E2FF8E143DA58C)

### A RE-IMPLEMENTATION
- Take an academic paper or other pre-existing project and implement it, or a portion of it.
- Examples:
  - [2D Wavefunction Collapse Pokémon Town](https://gurtd.github.io/566-final-project/)
  - [3D Wavefunction Collapse Dungeon Generator](https://github.com/whaoran0718/3dDungeonGeneration)
  - [Reaction Diffusion](https://github.com/charlesliwang/Reaction-Diffusion)
  - [WebGL Erosion](https://github.com/LanLou123/Webgl-Erosion)
  - [Particle Waterfall](https://github.com/chloele33/particle-waterfall)
  - [Voxelized Bread](https://github.com/ChiantiYZY/566-final)

### A FORGERY
Taking inspiration from a particular natural phenomenon or distinctive set of visuals, implement a detailed, procedural recreation of that aesthetic. This includes modeling, texturing and object placement within your scene. Does not need to be real-time. Focus on detail and visual accuracy in your implementation.
- Examples:
  - [The Shrines](https://github.com/byumjin/The-Shrines)
  - [Watercolor Shader](https://github.com/gracelgilbert/watercolor-stylization)
  - [Sunset Beach](https://github.com/HanmingZhang/homework-final)
  - [Sky Whales](https://github.com/WanruZhao/CIS566FinalProject)
  - [Snail](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ld3Gz2)
  - [Journey](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ldlcRf)
  - [Big Hero 6 Wormhole](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-R-6AN2cWjwg/VTyIzIQSQfI/AAAAAAAABLA/GC0yzzz4wHw/s1600/big-hero-6-disneyscreencaps.com-10092.jpg)

### A GAME LEVEL
- Like generations of game makers before us, create a game which generates an navigable environment (eg. a roguelike dungeon, platforms) and some sort of goal or conflict (eg. enemy agents to avoid or items to collect). Aim to create an experience that will challenge players and vary noticeably in different playthroughs, whether that means procedural dungeon generation, careful resource management or an interesting AI model. Focus on designing a system that is capable of generating complex challenges and goals.
- Examples:
  - [Rhythm-based Mario Platformer](https://github.com/sgalban/platformer-gen-2D)
  - [Pokémon Ice Puzzle Generator](https://github.com/jwang5675/Ice-Puzzle-Generator)
  - [Abstract Exploratory Game](https://github.com/MauKMu/procedural-final-project)
  - [Tiny Wings](https://github.com/irovira/TinyWings)
  - Spore
  - Dwarf Fortress
  - Minecraft
  - Rogue

### AN ANIMATED ENVIRONMENT / MUSIC VISUALIZER
- Create an environment full of interactive procedural animation. The goal of this project is to create an environment that feels responsive and alive. Whether or not animations are musically-driven, sound should be an important component. Focus on user interactions, motion design and experimental interfaces.
- Examples:
  - [The Darkside](https://github.com/morganherrmann/thedarkside)
  - [Music Visualizer](https://yuruwang.github.io/MusicVisualizer/)
  - [Abstract Mesh Animation](https://github.com/mgriley/cis566_finalproj)
  - [Panoramical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBTTMNFXHTk)
  - [Bound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE37l6RvF-c)

### YOUR OWN PROPOSAL
- You are of course welcome to propose your own topic . Regardless of what you choose, you and your team must research your topic and relevant techniques and come up with a detailed plan of execution. You will meet with some subset of the procedural staff before starting implementation for approval.
